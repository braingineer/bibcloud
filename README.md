# a way to view bibs

[bib.cloud](https://bib.cloud)

1. put .bib files into bibs/ folder
2. run bibstack.py 
3. upload new files (in _drafts) to github


### meta data for bib files:
```
% title: Some Titles
% categories: bibs
% date: 8/17/2016
% description: a collection of papers
```


## extra:

1. There is also a work-in-progress: arxiv2bib.py
  - this will eventually take a list of arxiv ids and output a bib file
