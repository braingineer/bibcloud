  <p>This document details my plan to go from 6.7 million features to much less. <br />
It also details the flattening of the chains for classification-signal training and <br />
the heuristics for their subsequent pruning.</p>

<h3 id="current-feature-sets">Current feature Sets</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Our current feature set is:
    <ol>
      <li>head word</li>
      <li>template
        <ul>
          <li>bracketed string with head word replaced with “”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>surface form</li>
      <li>surface form with empties</li>
      <li>children relationships
        <ul>
          <li>headword -&gt; headword</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What can I reduce?
    <ol>
      <li>headword
        <ul>
          <li>i should keep this one. it reflects standard word embeddings. right?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>template
        <ul>
          <li>i used this as my argument it encodes the grammar. but does it?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>surface form
        <ul>
          <li>i was using this to capture the out of place word order</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>surface form with empties
        <ul>
          <li>i was using this to capture arguments-to-come</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>children relationships
        <ul>
          <li>this encodes graph structure.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What are some alternatives?
    <ol>
      <li>Using POS tags somehow</li>
      <li>Some sort of featurizing so that</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="different-datapoints">Different datapoints</h3>
<ol>
  <li>good paths
    <ul>
      <li>these were outputs from the CSG that had correct word order &amp; unified to the predicates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>bad paths
    <ul>
      <li>these were outputs from the CSG that didn’t have the correct word order</li>
      <li>the issue is that some of their subtrees DO have correct word order</li>
      <li>there is usually a lot more of these than of the good paths. like 20-1 type disparity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="reduction-methods">Reduction methods</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Sub sample the number of bad paths
    <ul>
      <li>we might also have to regenerate paths, this time only letting the timer kicked it out when there is at least one generated good parse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reduce all features to just head words
    <ul>
      <li>this is an experiment I should run anyway</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reduce surface form to ngram context
    <ul>
      <li>though, isn’t it already?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Did this feb 11</strong>: reduced the feature set to the first 3 features.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="other-investigations">Other investigations</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I should actually be counting the number of features by source. Why I didn’t think of this, I dont know.
    <ul>
      <li>Did this. I got these <a href="#output-from-feature-conversion">logs</a></li>
      <li>Basically, this means that the 4th and 5th features are completely bogus.
        <ul>
          <li>These are the word order and word order with empty-argument markers</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Or rather, we’ll never know because there’s just simply too much .</li>
      <li>so now I’m running it without these.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
